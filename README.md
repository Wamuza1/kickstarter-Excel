# kickstarter-Excel
Excel project for analyzing kickstarter

## Overview of Project
Louise who is an up-coming playwright. She wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. She is estimating a budget of over $10,000. She is hesitant about her first fundraising campaign. She needs our help, as an excel expert to explore the dataset and help her achieving her goals. 

### Purpose
In this project, we will be using Excel to be organizing and sorting crowdfunding data and helping her with various analysis, visualizations, and feedback to ensure that she will have a better understanding of campaigns from start to finish.

## Analysis and Challenges
The first step of an analysis is to take an initial look at the data. There are various columns such as:
Goal column tells us how much money each compaign will need to succeed.
Pledged column shows how much each compaign made.
Outcomes column tells us if compaign met its goal.
Country columns has a list of various countries in which the compaign was started.
We may notice that the data in the columns need to be converted, Dates, in the 
readable format. We need to split categories and sub subcategories. creating new Year column based on the Date Created conversion column. New column for Percentage Funded and Average funded. we need to format the dataset by applying conditional formatting, formulas, and filters to display only the specific data that we want to focus on.

1.The pivot table and pivot chart based on outcomes of the “Parent Category”.
As we can conslude that "Theather" category had the most most successful outcome.Further, we can use filters to see the outcome for each country.

 2. The pivot table and pivot chart based on outcomes of the “SubCategory”.
 we created a new Pivot table and pivot chart filtered by subcategory to focus our analysis on an area that is more relevant for Louise. We can visualize that the within the subcategories " Play" was the most successful of all. By filtering for the "US", there were total 3,038 Kickstarter campaigns and the play was the most successful subcategory with 412.For the " Great Britain's " there were 604 Kickstarter campaigns and 238 successful plays.

  3.The pivot table and pivot chart based on overall outcomes of the “Launch Date”.
  We can see by looking at our line chart that the months of May and June both had a successful Kickstarter campaigns.Moreover, in January, June , July, and October all had the same number of failed Kickstarter campaigns launched.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
