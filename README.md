## Overview of Project

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
The first step of an analysis is to take an initial look at the data. There are various columns such as:
Goal column tells us how much money each compaign will need to succeed.
Pledged column shows how much each compaign made.
Outcomes column tells us if compaign met its goal.
Country columns has a list of various countries in which the compaign was started.
We may notice that the data in the columns need to be converted, Dates, in the 
readable format. We need to split categories and sub subcategories. creating new Year column based on the Date Created conversion column. New column for Percentage Funded and Average funded. we need to format the dataset by applying conditional formatting, formulas, and filters to display only the specific data that we want to focus on.
